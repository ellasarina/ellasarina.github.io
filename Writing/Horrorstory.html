When I was little, I would beg my parents to keep the hall light on at night. Even then, I was afraid of sleeping alone, creeping into my parents&#39; bed after I deemed an appropriate amount of time, which was probably only about twenty minutes after I&rsquo;d been put to bed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">It&rsquo;s funny, in the light, nothing frightens me. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But in the dark, shadows scare me more than anything else. They move and twist strangely and I can&rsquo;t help but see something looming, creeping on the edges of my vision. Things that aren&rsquo;t there, but must be, because I can </span><span class="c1 c3">feel</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;them. Feel the shift in movement, a shiver in the air. The light flickers on and there&rsquo;s nothing in the space where something </span><span class="c1 c3">must</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;have been.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Silence is something that has always bothered me, as well. It lays heavily, a pressure on my head that buzzes around my ears. Sometimes, I hear things, my brain trying desperately to fill that horrifying space, to push back against the sickening pressure. I cannot move, terrified that any small sound would alert whatever hid in the shadows.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I can do darkness or silence. But I can&rsquo;t do both.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This instinct, this fear --I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s irrational, not really. Since the dawn of time, humans have been afraid of what lurks in the dark. With subpar night vision, they relied on fire to keep them safe, knowing that stepping out of that sphere of light could mean a swift and brutal death. While the immediate threat is not </span><span class="c1 c3">so</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;prevalent anymore, the fear remains rooted deep in our subconscious. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">But you don&rsquo;t want to hear about that, do you? My childhood fears are not why I&rsquo;m here. You want to know what happened the night of July 7th. Well, so do I.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It was a regular night, nothing unusual at all. No off feeling, nothing warning me not to go out that night. I was walking downtown with my friend and once roommate Jenn Pastor, slightly tipsy as we&rsquo;d been barhopping, trying to find the pulse of the city. Jenn is-- well, </span><span class="c1 c3">was</span><span class="c2 c1">, I suppose-- never scared of anything. She had a fantastic resting bitch face and don&#39;t-fuck-with-me attitude that sent creeps running, despite her short stature. She&rsquo;d be the one to tell assholes at the bar to piss off if they got handsy. Even fought a guy for me once. I&rsquo;ll miss her. I know the official report says she&rsquo;s missing. But I know she&rsquo;s dead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There&rsquo;s a fear every woman knows, walking in the dark. It usually has stinking breath and a jeering smile. I was never afraid of that when Jenn was with me. So when she hooked her arm in mine and whispered that something was following us and to stay close, the fear in her voice sent chills down my spine. It didn&rsquo;t strike me as odd at the time, that she had said &ldquo;some</span><span class="c1 c3">thing</span><span class="c1">&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;some</span><span class="c1 c3">one</span><span class="c2 c1">&rdquo;. Hindsight is 20/20, I suppose, and fear whites out those little details. My first instinct was to look back, but Jenn kept a tight hold on my arm.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she hissed. So I didn&rsquo;t. We walked faster, Jenn stealing careful glances backwards. Every time she did, I saw this-- I don&rsquo;t know-- this </span><span class="c1 c3">glaze</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;start to creep over her eyes. Then she&rsquo;d blink and it was gone. Each time, it took an extra second to recede, and I felt the hair on the back of my neck begin to stand up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;I heard, well, not footsteps behind us, but a kind of scraping. Like a large, wet fish being dragged across the stone. It wasn&rsquo;t loud, and I could barely hear it above the sound of the city, but it was just not </span><span class="c1 c3">right</span><span class="c2 c1">. I found myself picturing some kind of aquatic monstrocity pulling its writhing body closer and closer, despite our pace. The scraping was louder now, echoing off of the brick walls around us. This noise send an involuntary shiver down my spine and Jenn must have thought I was trying to wiggle away-- to see what was following-- because she clamped down on my arm hard enough to bruise.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Lu, </span><span class="c1 c3">please</span><span class="c2 c1">,&rdquo; her short nails dug into my skin through the thin coat, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t want to see&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d never heard her voice crack before. I nodded, trying to swallow around the lump growing in my throat.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">After a few tense minutes, we emerged from the alley into the familiar light and business of downtown, and ducked into the first bar we found. It was Skarpy&rsquo;s, I think. Under the fluorescents, Jenn looked a lot paler than usual, dark eyes standing out starkly on her face. I got us drinks, and a little table near the back where we could see the door. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&ldquo;Its nothing,&rdquo; she said. It obviously wasn&rsquo;t nothing, I mean, she could barely hold her beer she was shaking so badly, and her short hair was a mess where she&rsquo;d been running her hands through it. I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t ask. Didn&rsquo;t push more. Maybe she&rsquo;d still be alive if I had. But that was one of the reasons we were best friends. We could drink and talk, and not be afraid together. She made me feel safe. I like to think I made her feel strong. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">So, that&rsquo;s what we did. We drank and talked about everything but whatever it was that kept our eyes trained on the door. Eventually, the alcohol overruled the fear in our systems and we were able to properly enjoy the night. Jenn&rsquo;s apartment was closer, and neither of us were in any state to be travelling alone, so we went there, in the end. The walk was blessedly uneventful and we were stumbling into bed in no time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I don&#39;t know what time it was when I awoke. My throat felt like sandpaper and I was desperately thirsty. In my half-hungover state, I didn&rsquo;t notice the cool white light emanating from the living room until I was halfway down the hallway. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&ldquo;Jenn?&rdquo; I called. There was no response, and the light flickered off suddenly right before I rounded the corner. I almost immediately slammed my shin into the coffee table.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">&ldquo;Shit, Jenn! Turn the light back on, I can&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">My eyes adjusted after a long, uncoordinated moment of feeling around in the darkness. She was standing behind the armchair, but her silhouette looked </span><span class="c1 c3">wrong</span><span class="c1">. Too tall and too still. Her gaze met mine and I </span><span class="c1 c3">knew</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;it wasn&rsquo;t Jenn. The eyes were a bright, glowing white. This was not Jenn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Whatever it was opened its mouth and the room burst into a stark, cold light. It was like the matter that made up the room had never known shadow. I-I don&rsquo;t know what I saw standing behind the armchair. It had too many limbs and burned to look at. So I looked down. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">I&rsquo;ll see the curled and shrivelled face of Jenn Pastor turned upward in that horrified grimace for the rest of my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Her skin looked as though it had all the moisture sucked from it, stretched unnaturally over the bones beneath. Hands formed grasping claws at her throat. She looked so small, crumpled in that armchair. But her eyes. Her eyes were completely the same. Completely </span><span class="c1 c3">alive</span><span class="c2 c1">. She saw me and I saw her and I could see the pain and regret and fear in her shining gaze for a fraction of a moment.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">I watched the thing&rsquo;s wretched limbs curl around her, growing, obscuring Jenn&rsquo;s withered body. Her eyes pleaded with me, to help, to run, to do </span><span class="c1 c3">anything.</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;I was frozen in place, trapped by this all-exposing light. I watched her beautiful dark eyes be engulfed by the glaze I&rsquo;d seen in the alley until they were completely white.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I-I don&rsquo;t really know what happened next. The light was sucked out of the room and left me alone in the darkness. I must have been screaming, because the cops showed up at some point. I tried to explain it, to tell them what had happened, but they didn&rsquo;t find anything, and probably didn&rsquo;t believe me anyway. It didn&rsquo;t take paramedics to tell me I wouldn&rsquo;t be regaining my sight. I knew that the moment the light went out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In some ways, it&rsquo;s a blessing. See, whatever it was that killed Jenn, I think it relies on sight. When it burned out my eyes, it couldn&rsquo;t find me. But I think it&rsquo;s finding other ways. Last night, I heard the wet dragging in the parking lot of my apartment building. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here. When it finds me, and it </span><span class="c1 c3">will</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;find me, I don&rsquo;t want to be just another missing person. I want someone to know what happened. And if you can find this thing, stop it. Kill it, if you can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m scared of the dark anymore. </span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p></body></html>
